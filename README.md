# Foreyes
## üì∫ Compare how your webpage looks in different browsers! üì∫

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Typeform/kitt.svg?token=axsNaJqw6sjfoKFeCyDk&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Typeform/Foreyes)

We want to ensure our design is consistent across our supported browsers. Sadly, this is typically done in a manual fashion. Foreyes aims to fix that problem.

Here's how it works: Foreyes screenshoots a webpage in a baseline browser (the one where we usually develop), and then compares it with the screenshots of other browsers. Then announce the pixel differences, if any!

The currently supported browsers are Chrome (as the baseline), Firefox, and IE11 & Safari (through Browserstack).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Foreyes is a CLI tool that uses `node.js` and `yarn`; so be insured to have them installed. And because Foreyes uses Selenium, have `Java` installed too.

Additionally, at the moment IE11 and Safari are run on browserstack. If you use them, be sure to export these ENV vars.
```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME
BROWSERSTACK_KEY
```

### Installing

Foreyes is a Typeform's **private** NPM package. So configure your NPM token in your project, then add the package:

```bash
echo //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN} > .npmrc
yarn add @typeform/foreyes
```

Foreyes has the following command to easily create the necessary config files (under `foreyesConfig`):

```bash
yarn foreyes setup
```

## Running

Foreyes can visually compare URLs directly. Add URLs to the list at `foreyesConfig/fixturesUrls.json`. Then use `yarn foreyes test-urls` to run them.

There are 3 byproducts of a test execution:
1. Information on the command line, including the percentage of difference between browsers.
2. Screenshots (original, and difference) under the screenshots folder.
3. A pretty HTML report in `foreyesConfig/report/index.html`

These tools can be very useful in diagnosing why exactly the execution has failed.

## Other uses

There are other ways to use Foreyes.

### Testing a design system

Originally, Foreyes was designed to work with Design Systems! It has since become a more flexible tool; however that functionality is still there, maintained.

So, if you're interested in visually comparing specific mounted components, check out this [cool guide!](./TESTING-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md)

### CI (Travis)

Travis has to work with Java (for Selenium), and have Chrome and Firefox (and their drivers) available. Foreyes will download most of these things as dependencies, but not all of them.

Therefore, add in .travis.yml:

```yml
addons:
  chrome: stable

before_install:
  - echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > .npmrc
  - export MOZ_HEADLESS=1

script:
  - yarn foreyes test-urls
```
