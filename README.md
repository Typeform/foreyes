# KATT
## üì∫ Visually detects changes accross browsers in any of your projects! 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Typeform/kitt.svg?token=axsNaJqw6sjfoKFeCyDk&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Typeform/KATT)


KATT allows you to mount pages with any component's every visual combination \([kitchen sink pages](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/component-qa-in-design-systems-b18cb4decb9c)), or your custom templates too. There are also helpers to create these pages. 
It additionally supports any given url, opening the possibilities check the layout of any project.

After creating the pages, they will be visually compared across browsers: currently Chrome (master) against Firefox and IE11.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

KATT tests `React` components, so it also uses `node.js` and `yarn`. Your Design System project should work with these 3 technologies.

At the moment, IE11 is run on browserstack. Be sure to add these ENV vars on your machine with your data.
```
BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME
BROWSERSTACK_KEY
```

### Installing

KATT is a Typeform's **private** NPM package. So configure your NPM token in your project, then add the package:

```bash
echo //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN} > .npmrc
yarn add @typeform/katt
yarn katt setup
```

### (Optional) Configuring in Travis

In package.json, add:
```
scripts: {
    "katt-start-server": "yarn katt run-server &",
    "katt-run-tests": "yarn katt test-all"
    //...
```

In .travis.yml, add:
```
addons:
  chrome: stable

before_install:
  - echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}" > .npmrc
  - export MOZ_HEADLESS=1

before_script:
  - yarn katt-start-server

script:
  - yarn katt-run-tests
```

## Execution
### Running against a URL

KATT can visually compare URLs directly. Add URLs to the list in the `kattConfig/fixturesUrls.json`. Then use `yarn katt test-urls`


*Next steps: Refactor so .storybook config folder doesn't need to be pasted into the root*
